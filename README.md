# Dotfiles
## Setup 
The setup.sh install the different dependencies, but only for debian (apt needed)
The link_setup.sh is for the different symlink creation

### nvim
The nvim config use a git with all the config but depend on the different 
dependencies which are specified in the README of the git, there is a script in the docs
folder but it does not seems to work

### zsh
The zsh setup use oh-my-zsh and different plugins that need to be install if 
at the start of zsh it does not find the plugins. The exa packages make the beautifull icons but 
I don't know how it is setup, it works some time ;)...
